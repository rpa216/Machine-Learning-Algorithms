Following points to take into consideration before running the program

1. All the program that been submitted in the folder are independent of each other 
2. All the parameter values required by the function in the program have been initialized in the main function
3. Following libraries have used for the importing different functions:
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
	import sys
	import math
4. Kindly note the output of all the program is Vector output of the Function over the number of iteration and graphical output
5. The output graph may sometime show a wrong output due to the values randomly sampled at the input. Kindly request you to rerun the program
6. Regarding the AgaGrad run for equation 3 I was not able to tune the parameter to optimal value hence I could not get any kind of convergence
